    <h1>Passive Voice</h1>
    <p>Passive voice is a grammatical construction where the subject of a sentence is the receiver of the action rather than the doer of the action. In passive voice sentences, the focus is on the action or the receiver of the action, rather than the person or thing performing the action.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Passive Voice:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The book was written by the author.</li>
      <li>The cake was baked by my mom.</li>
      <li>The report will be presented by her.</li>
      <li>A letter was written by him to the CEO.</li>
      <li>The event is being organized by the committee.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Usage of Passive Voice:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant, or obvious from the context.</li>
      <li>When the focus is on the receiver of the action rather than the doer of the action.</li>
      <li>When the speaker wants to be vague or diplomatic about the doer of the action.</li>
      <li>When describing processes or actions in a scientific or technical context.</li>
      <li>When writing in a more formal or impersonal tone.</li>
    </ul>
