  <h1>Active Voice</h1>
  <p>Active voice is a grammatical term used to describe a sentence where the subject of the sentence performs the action expressed by the verb. In active voice, the subject is the doer of the action, and the sentence is typically structured as "subject + verb + object".</p>
  <h2>Examples:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The cat chased the mouse.</li>
    <li>She sings a song.</li>
    <li>They built a sandcastle on the beach.</li>
    <li>He reads a book.</li>
    <li>The chef is cooking dinner.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Advantages of Active Voice:</h2>
  <p>Active voice is often preferred in writing and communication because it is more direct, concise, and engaging. It clearly identifies the subject as the doer of the action, making the sentence more engaging and impactful. Active voice also tends to be more efficient and uses fewer words compared to passive voice.</p>
  <h2>Usage of Active Voice:</h2>
  <p>Active voice is commonly used in various situations, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the subject is known and important.</li>
    <li>When emphasizing the doer of the action </li>
    <li>When expressing clear and concise ideas.</li>
    <li>When writing in a more engaging and dynamic style.</li>
    <li>When conveying a sense of responsibility or accountability.</li>
    
      </ul>
