				<li>A verb is a word that expresses an action, an occurrence, or a state of being.</li></p>
                <li>Examples of verbs include <em>run</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>speak</em>, <em>walk</em>, <em>fly</em>, <em>cut</em>, <emplay</em>, <em>write</em>, and many others.</li>
                <p>Verbs can be used in different tenses (present, past, future) and in different forms (infinitive, gerund, participle). They can also be transitive or intransitive, depending on whether they take an object or not.</p>
                <li>A verb is a word that expresses an action, an occurrence, or a state of being.</li>
			<p></p><li>Verbs are often called the "doing" words because they indicate some kind of action, such as running or jumping.</li>
			<p></p><li>However, not all verbs describe physical actions. For example, the verb "think" doesn't involve any physical movement, but it still describes an action.</li>
			<p></p><li>Verbs can also describe a state of being or existence, such as "be" or "exist".</li>
			<p></p><li>Verbs can be used in different tenses to indicate when the action occurred. For example, "I run" is in the present tense, while "I ran" is in the past tense.</li>
			<p></p><li>Verbs can also be modified by adverbs to indicate how the action was done. For example, "I ran quickly" uses the adverb "quickly" to modify the verb "ran".</li>
			<p></p><li>Some verbs can be transitive, meaning they require an object to complete their meaning, while others are intransitive, meaning they don't require an object. For example, in the sentence "She ate a sandwich", "ate" is transitive because it requires the object "sandwich" to complete its meaning.</li>
			<p></p><li>Verbs can also be regular or irregular, depending on whether they follow a predictable pattern when forming their past tense and past participle forms. For example, "walk" is a regular verb because its past tense and past participle forms are formed by adding "-ed" to the base form, while "eat" is an irregular verb because its past tense and past participle forms are "ate" and "eaten", respectively.</li>
